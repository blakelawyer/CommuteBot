// When a ride request arrives

// We need to find drivers who are currently on schedule
    // From the DB

// When the rider requests a ride, the bot sends a message to the drivers channel
    // '@' drivers on the schedule
    // There's an embed containing the ride info
    // There's an accept button
    // Google maps link?
    // Connect the rider and driver in a text channel
